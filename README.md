# Goals App

This is an app I started in November 2011 to help keep track of goals.

The goal was to keep it simple, and have an interface that resembeled having
each goal on an index card, and filing it under one of three categories:
focused, active/maintaining, or someday.

I learned a bunch of new things while building this app, but didn't get it 
to a finished state, and probably never will. Consider this abandoned...
